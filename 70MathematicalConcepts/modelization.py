# With these few functions
# virtual experiments can easily be conducted.

# For example, we can simply obtain the volume
# occupied by one mole of gas under standard
# conditions:
print(volume(T0, P0))
#> 0.022412722427831235 (in litres)

# We can verify that the temperature is
# correct for standard pressure
# and volume:
print(temperature(P0,volume(T0, P0)))
#> 273.15

# Doubling the pressure
# yields the following temperature:
print(temperature(2 * P0,
                  volume(T0, P0)))
#> 546.3
